## Comparison operators
 
* When we compare two values using string the result will be in True or False (Boolean).
== Compare the value only (is equal to)
=== Compare the value and the datatype 
!=  compare two values to see if there not the same (is not equal to)
!== compare two values to check if datatype and the value are not the same (strict not equal to) 
* Evaluating the condition: testing or checking of a condition
*	Every value can be treated as true or false even if it is not a Boolean 
*	In short circle evaluation a condition might not need to run.
*	The enclosing brackets are important when the expression is used as a condition in comparison operators.

## Logical operators

To compare the results of more than one comparison operator

*	Sometimes we donâ€™t need to evaluate the hole condition

* Ex: False && (true /False) always will be false. 

### Loops

There are 3 types of loops:

1. While loop ( the loop will continue run for as long as the condition in parentheses is true
2. for loop
3. Do while loop
