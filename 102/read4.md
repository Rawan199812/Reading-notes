## Intro + Scripts
jQuery makes writing JavaScript a lot easier.
Javascript makes web page more interactive by:
1. Access Content
2. Modify Content
3. Program rules or instructions the browser can follow
4. React to events triggered by the user or browser
- A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.
- Scripts can run different sections of the code in response to the situation around them.
- When we state our goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed and break it down into smaller tasks, and learn one of these at a time. This way it seems simpler.
- We ca represent tasks using a Flowchart.
- Every step for every task shown in a flowchart needs to be written in a language the computer can understand and follow.
*Debugging* : several ways to discover what might have gone wrong
The flowcharts show the paths between each step.


## Expressions + Operators
There are two types of expressions:
1. Expressions That Just Assign A Value To A Variable.
2. Expressions That Use Two Or More Values To Return A Single Value.
*Operators*: Expressions allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.
- Assignment operators: Assign a value to a variable color 
- Arithmetic operators: Perform basic math 
- String operators: Combine two strings
- There is just one string operator: the+ symbol. It is used to join the strings on either side of it.
*Concatenation*: the process of joining together two or more strings to create one new string
