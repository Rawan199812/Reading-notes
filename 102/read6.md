FUNCTION
- Grouping together the statements to do a specific task.
- Function offer a way to store the steps needed to achieve a task.
calling the function : give a function name (should describe the task it is performing. So we can function to perform its task later.
- A code block consists of one or more statements contained within curly braces. (We don't write a semicolon)
*Parameters*: Pieces of information passed to a function
- Return value: the response when we write a function and  we expect it to provide us with an answer.
Update Message (): 
- The function has a name, update Message, and the value is the code block.  When we call the function by its name, those statements will run.
*Anonymous functions*: functions do not have a name , so they cannot be called. Instead, they are executed as soon as the interpreter comes across them.  - The message is held in an HTML element whose id attribute has a value of message.
-we can see the link to the JavaScript file before the closing < /body >tag.
-The JavaScript file starts with a variable used to hold a new message, and is followed by the update Message().
There are 2 ways to write function:
1. Function declaration
2. Function expression
Function declaration:
How we write?
We give the function a name then we write the statement inside the {}
- We can call the same function as many times as we want within the same JavaScript file
- When we design a script we need to note the information the function will require the in order to performs tasks. ( because sometimes there is function need specific information to performs tasks). When we call it we specify the values(it should use in parentheses that follow is name.
- Some functions return information to the code that called him.

***Css***

we can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:
1. rgb values 
(Express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up 
2. Hex codes 
These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash .
3.Color names
Recognized by browsers. 
- to add comments to your CSS files:Anything between the /* symbols and the */ symbols will not be interpreted by the browser.
- Comments can help us to understand a CSS file (and organize it, by splitting a long document into sections).
- If we do not specify a background color, then the background is transparent.
- We use a color picker to find the color we want.

*Contrastit* is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be legible.

*Opacity*: to specify the opacity of an element and any of its child elements. Between(0.0 and 1.0)

*HSL Colorway*: to specify colors using hue, saturation, and lightness values.
