# Chapter 8: Extra Markup
-DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.
* we use < !-- -- > to add a comment (will not be visible in the user's)
(To remained myself why I do that or to tell my team ) 

*ID Attribute*: It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page. Also known as a global attribute because it can be used on any element.

*There are two type of elements Block and Inline:

- Block Elements : elements appear to start on a new line in the browser window. Examples :
< h1 >, < p >, < ul >, and < li >.
- Inline Elements : elements appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements. Examples :
< a >, < b >, < em >, and < img >
* The < div > element: allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box.
* The < span > element: acts like an inline equivalent of the element. 
* The < iframe >: we can see another page in our page. (Inline frame.)
* The < src >attribute: specifies the URL of the page to show in the frame. 
* The< height > attribute: specifies the height of the iframe in pixels. The < width > attribute: specifies the width of the iframe in pixels.
* < meta > :we write it inside the head. It contains information about that web page. 
* Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages 
such as , and Â©.

# Chapter 17:HTML5 Layout  
HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page.

We can use<header> and <footer> appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.

* < nav > :used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.

* < article>: acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.

* < aside > :we use it to depending on whether it is inside an element or not.
* If it used inside an element: it should contain information that is related to the article but not essential to its overall meaning
* If it used outside of an element: it acts as a container for content that is related to the entire page
* < section > :related content together and typically each section would have its own heading.

# Chapter 18 :Process & Design

We should know who we expect to use my website ( my audience)
- The audience can influence design decisions from color palettes to level of detail in descriptions. And we need to consider why People Visit my Website.
I have to figure out what information my visitors need and provide it to them.
- There are some sites people will visit a lot like news so I have to think of how many times people will open my website .

*Site map*: create a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site.

*Wireframe*: it shows how the page should look after we finished.
- Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.

- Headings Giving a chunk of information a heading clearly tells the user whether or not the content of the grouping is relevant to them.
