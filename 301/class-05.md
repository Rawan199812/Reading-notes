## Deploying a Simple Blog to Heroku

***What is Heroku?***

**Heroku is a cloud platform that lets companies build, deliver, monitor and scale apps.**

***Works fine. But it works locally. WWW is for "World Wide Web" and we will turn our local server into a world wide server. We'll use Heroku cloud application platform for this. Heroku is a cloud platform as a service (cool long-bearded programmer guys call such type of things "PaaS"). It allows to us to deploy your web server, so everyone could see how awesome you are as a web developer. First of all, you need to create an account on developer's site and install Heroku. This is not so hard. Just follow the instructions. There is also instruction on Heroku's site that can explain to us how to run your first simple web server, which returns the "Hello, World!" string.***
