## EJS

**EJS is a template system. we define HTML pages in the EJS syntax and we specify where various data will go in the page. Then, my app combines data with the template and "renders" a complete HTML page where EJS takes my data and inserts it into the web page according to how I've defined the template.**
- For example, we could have a table of dynamic data from a database and we want EJS to generate the table of data according to your display rules. It saves you from the drudgery of writing code to dynamically generate HTML based on data.
