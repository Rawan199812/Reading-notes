## Diversity and Inclusion
**The share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.**

***This idea that computers are for boys became a narrative. It became the story we told ourselves about the computing revolution. It helped define who geeks were, and it created techie culture.***

- Diversity efforts are most successful when theyâ€™re driven by a commitment from company leaders. And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters.
- Diverse groups of people bring to organizations more and different ways of seeing a problem and, thus, faster/better ways of solving it.
- Given that diverse teams are smarter and more creative than homogeneous ones, it is unsurprising that a wealth of research shows a strong correlation between diverse organizations and positive financial outcomes.
***When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups.***
**diversity matters and articulating its importance, leaders must create a strategy for building a more diverse, inclusive company and an accountability plan to ensure that strategy is effective.**
