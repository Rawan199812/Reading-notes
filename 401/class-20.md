## What is Django?
A high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. 

***Django helps to write software:***

- Complete : provides almost everything developers might want to do "out of the box". 

- Versatile : used to build almost any type of website — from content management systems and wikis, through to social networks and news sites. 

- Secure : protect the website automatically.

- Scalable :  Having a clear separation between the different parts means that it can scale for increased traffic by adding hardware at any level

- Portable : you are not tied to any particular server platform, and can run your applications on many flavours of Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. 

- Django provides a secure way to manage user accounts and passwords, avoiding common mistakes like putting session information in cookies where it is vulnerable (instead cookies just contain a key, and the actual data is stored in the database) or directly storing passwords rather than a password hash

***Django provides multiple protections against:***

- Clickjacking
- Cross-site scripting
- Cross Site Request Forgery
- SQL injection
- Remote code execution

## How Django Works Behind the Scenes

**Django is a Python-based web framework used by millions of developers and billions of consumers through popular apps like Instagram. It is open source, meaning the code is available for free on Github and can be downloaded onto any developer’s computer and used alongside the official documentation.**

- Django web applications manage and query data through Python objects referred to as models. Models
define
- One of the best ways to become more involved in Django is to attend an annual conference and meet all the contributors in person. Currently there are DjangoCons in the US, Europe, Australia, and Africa in 2020 for the first time.
