## Linked lists
**Linked List:** is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.

***There are two types of Linked List:***
- Singly
* Doubly
Node : is the individual items/links that live in a linked list. Each node contains the data for each link.
Singly : refers to the number of references the node has. A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.

Doubly : refers to there being two (double) references within the node. A Doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node.
Next : This property contains the reference to the next node.
Head : This property contains the reference to the first node in a linked list.
The best way to traverse through a linked list is using of a while() loop not forEach or for loop

***Current: is node that will tell us where exactly in the linked list we are and will allow us to move/traverse forward until we hit the end.***

**When constructing your code, a few things to keep in mind :**

- When making your Node class, consider requiring a value to be passed in to require that each node has a value.

- When making a Linked List, you may want to require that at least one node gets passed in upon instantiation. This first node is what your Head and Current will point too.

- linear data structures : which means that there is a sequence and an order to how they are constructed and traversed.

- Non-linear data structures : items donâ€™t have to be arranged in order, which means that we could traverse the data structure non-sequentially.

- The fundamental difference between arrays and linked lists is that arrays are static data structures, while linked lists are dynamic data structures.

- linked list can be small or huge, but no matter the size, the parts that make it up are actually fairly simple. A linked list is made up of a series of nodes, which are the elements of the list.

**Singly linked lists : are the simplest type of linked list**

**Doubly linked list : there are two references contained within each node: a reference to the next node, as well as the previous node**

**a linked list is usually efficient when it comes to adding and removing most elements, but can be very slow to search and find a single element**

***When we need arrays OR linked lists ?***

**arrays : if you do know the size of the list , you need random access to elements or want to iterate quickly**

**linked lists : if you dont know the size of the list ,and mostly want to add or remove things quickly without random access**
