### Machine Learning Intro

**Machine learning should not be haphazard and piecemeal. It should be systematic and organized.**

***'Better data beats fancier algorithms'***

- There’s a lot of trial and error, so how do you avoid chasing dead ends? The answer is “Exploratory Analysis.”
- After properly completing the Data Cleaning step, we'll have a robust dataset that avoids many of the most common pitfalls.

**So this can really save you from a ton of headaches down the road.**

- Not all of the features you engineer need to be winners. In fact, you’ll often find that many of them don’t improve your model. That’s fine because one highly predictive feature makes up for 10 duds.

**The key is choosing machine learning algorithms that can automatically select the best features among many options (built-in feature selection).**


***The most effective algorithms typically offer a combination of regularization, automatic feature selection, ability to express nonlinear relationships, and/or ensembling. Those algorithms include:***

- Lasso regression
- Ridge regression
- Elastic-Net
- Random forest
- Boosted tree
