## Pain vs. Suffering
- The pain that we maybe will experience during this course like below :
* we will be pushed mentally, having to think your way through problems that you   had only even heard about a few hours beforehand.
* we will have to research for hours on end
* we will be pushed emotionally, constantly confronted with your own lack of understanding of a topic.

***The greater the growth, the greater the pain.***

**Suffering is pain without purpose. Pain with no higher goal. Pain with no dreams, no ambition, no aspiration.**

## A beginner's guide to Big O notation

***Big O notation :*** describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm.

***O(1) :*** describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.

***O(N) :*** describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set

***O(N2) :*** represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set. 

***O(2N) :*** denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each additon to the input data set.
***O(log N) :*** The iterative halving of data sets produces a growth curve that peaks at the beginning and slowly flattens out as the size of the data sets increase
## Names and Values in Python
**Names refers to values in python**
**Many names can refer to one value**
**If we have a list ,so if we modify it then all names that referring to that list will change**
**So the mechanisms almost the same between python and other languages ,but the effects can be surprising in python**

## How to Setup an Awesome Python Environment for Data Science or Anything Else

**The most important thing when working with python: the interpreter.**

**Pyenv :** Pyenv is a set of three tools, from which I present two here, that are pyenv(used to install python) andpyenv-virtualenv(used to configure your global tools).
- we can use pyenv to install almost any python interpreter, including pypy, and anaconda,etc ..
**Dependency Management**

**Poetry :** comes with all the tools you might need to manage your projects dependencies in a deterministic way.

***poetry helps us to easily :**

- manage projectsâ€™ dependencies

- separate projects through virtual environments

- build both applications as well as libraries without headaches
