## Data Visualization


***matplotlib: is probably the single most used Python package for 2D-graphics. It provides both a very quick way to visualize data from Python and publication-quality figures in many formats. We are going to explore matplotlib in interactive mode covering most common cases.***



***pyplot : provides a convenient interface to the matplotlib object-oriented plotting library. It is modeled closely after Matlab(TM). Therefore, the majority of plotting commands in pyplot have Matlab(TM) analogs with similar arguments. Important commands are explained with interactive examples.***

**Relating variables with scatter plots**

**The scatter plot is a mainstay of statistical visualization. It depicts the joint distribution of two variables using a cloud of points, where each point represents an observation in the dataset. This depiction allows the eye to infer a substantial amount of information about whether there is any meaningful relationship between them.**


- Scatter plots are highly effective, but there is no universally optimal type of visualisation. Instead, the visual representation should be adapted for the specifics of the dataset and to the question you are trying to answer with the plot.
