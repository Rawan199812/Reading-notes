***React Router***

**To get started with React Router in a web app, you’ll need a React web app. If you need to create one, we recommend you try Create React App. It’s a popular tool that works really well with React Router.**

**a collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with your application. Whether you want to have bookmarkable URLs for your web app or a composable way to navigate in React Native, React Router works wherever React is rendering--so take your pick!**

**Installation You can install React Router from the public npm registry with either npm or yarn. Since we’re building a web app, we’ll use react-router-dom in this guide.**

npm install react-router-dom

Next, copy/paste either of the following examples into src/App.js.

***To build a complete web application with React from scratch, there are many important details you need to consider:***
**Code has to be bundled using a bundler like webpack and transformed using a compiler like Babel**

- we need to do production optimizations such as code splitting.

- we might want to statically pre-render some pages for performance and SEO. You might also want to use server-side rendering or client-side rendering.

- we might have to write some server-side code to connect your React app to your data store.

***A framework can solve these problems. But such a framework must have the right level of abstraction — otherwise it won’t be very useful. It also needs to have great "Developer Experience", ensuring you and your team have an amazing experience while writing code.***
