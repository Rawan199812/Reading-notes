**Types(cases) of the linear ewgression :**

- Multiple Linear Regression With scikit-learn
- Polynomial Regression With scikit-learn
- Advanced Linear Regression With statsmodels
- Linear regression is sometimes not appropriate, especially for non-linear models of high complexity.

- When implementing linear regression of some dependent variable ùë¶ on the set of independent variables
**Five basic steps to implementlinear regression:**

1. Import the packages and classes you need.

import numpy as np

2. from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

3. Provide data to work with and eventually do appropriate transformations.

4. Create a regression model and fit it with existing data.

5. Check the results of model fitting to know whether the model is satisfactory.

6. Apply the model for predictions.

***When Do You Need Regression?***

**Typically, you need regression to answer whether and how some phenomenon influences the other or how several variables are related**



**Scikit-learn**:Is a powerful Python module for machine learning. It contains function for regression, classification, clustering, model selection and dimensionality reduction. Today, I will explore the sklearn
