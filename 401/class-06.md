## Random Module

***When to use it?***
when We want the computer to pick a random number in a given range

**Random functions:**

*Randint : If we wanted a random integer, we can use it and it accepts two parameters*

*Random : If you want a larger number, you can multiply it.*

*Choice : Generate a random value from the sequence , or random value from a list*

*Shuffle : shuffles the elements in list in place, so they are in a random order.*

*Randrange : Generate a randomly selected element from range(start, stop, step)*


## Risk Analysis


***What is Risk Analysis in Software Testing ?***

Risk Analysis : is the process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test

***Why use Risk Analysis?***
it highlights the potential problem areas. After knowing about the risk areas, it helps the developers and managers to mitigate the risks. When a test plan has been created, risks involved in testing the product are to be taken into consideration along with the possibility of the damage they may cause to your software along with solutions.

**Possible risks that you could encounter :**

- Use of new hardware

- Use of new technology

- Use of new automation tool

- The sequence of code

- Availability of test resources for the application

- unavoidable risks

- The time that you allocated for testing

- A defect leakage due to the complexity or size of the application

- Urgency from the clients to deliver the project

- Incomplete requirements

***How to perform Risk Analysis?***

1. Searching the risk

2. Analyzing the impact of each individual risk

3. Measures for the risk identified
