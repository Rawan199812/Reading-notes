### From the Duckett HTML book:

## Chapter 4: Links

***How to writ link?***

- To create a link: we us the < a > element and href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.



- The link text is the part that will be visible to the reader.

#### Absolute URL: 
when we link to a different website, the value of the href attribute will be the full web address for the site.

#### Relative URL:
When are are linking to other pages within the same site.

*mailto:* create a link that starts up the user's email program and addresses an email to a specified email address we use the < a >element

- If we want a link to open in a new window, we use the target attribute on the opening < a > tag. The value of this
attribute should be _blank.

- we can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.

## Chapter 15: Layout:

- The position CSS property sets how an element is positioned in a document. The top, right, bottom, and left properties determine the final location of positioned elements.

- The clear property allows you to say that no element should touch the left or righthand sides of a box. 

- If a containing element only contains floated elements, some browsers will treat it as if it is zero pixels tall.

***Why we our design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens?***

Because different visitors to our site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information

- web designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide

- Fixed width layout designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window.

- To create a fixed width layout the width of the main boxes on a page will usually be specified in pixels

- The liquid layout uses percentages to specify the width of each box so that the design will stretch to fit the size of the screen.

#### Possible Layouts:960 Pixel wide 12 Column Grid

- Some web page authors split up their CSS style rules into separate style sheets.

- We can include multiple CSS files in one page.

### From the Duckett JS book:

## Chapter 3:Functions, Methods, and Objects

FUNCTION

- Grouping together the statements to do a specific task.

- Function offer a way to store the steps needed to achieve a task.

calling the function : give a function name (should describe the task it is performing. So we can function to perform its task later.

- A code block consists of one or more statements contained within curly braces. (We don't write a semicolon)

*Parameters*: Pieces of information passed to a function

- Return value: the response when we write a function and  we expect it to provide us with an answer.

Update Message (): 
- The function has a name, update Message, and the value is the code block.  When we call the function by its name, those statements will run.

*Anonymous functions*: functions do not have a name , so they cannot be called. Instead, they are executed as soon as the interpreter comes across them.  - The message is held in an HTML element whose id attribute has a value of message.

-we can see the link to the JavaScript file before the closing < /body >tag.

-The JavaScript file starts with a variable used to hold a new message, and is followed by the update Message().

There are 2 ways to write function:
1. Function declaration
2. Function expression

Function declaration:

***How we write?***
We give the function a name then we write the statement inside the {}

- We can call the same function as many times as we want within the same JavaScript file

- When we design a script we need to note the information the function will require the in order to performs tasks. ( because sometimes there is function need specific information to performs tasks). When we call it we specify the values(it should use in parentheses that follow is name.

- Some functions return information to the code that called him.


***Why pair program?***

1. Greater efficiency

2. Engaged collaboration

3. Learning from fellow students

4. Social skills

5. Job interview readiness

6. Work environment readiness
