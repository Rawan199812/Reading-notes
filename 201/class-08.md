***What is the differants between the Block elements Inline elements?***

- Block-level elements start on a new line and Inline elements flow in between surrounding text.




- If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.


- we can control the layout of a page with positioning schemes: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning.

- we can float elements using the float property.
### positioning schemes:

- position:static (the elements should appear in normal flow)

- position:relative (moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow)

- position:absolute( the element should appear in relation to its containing element)

- position:fixed( a type of absolute positioning that requires the position property to have a value of fixed.) 


-The float property allows us to take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the left or right of the containing element as possible.

- The clear property allows us to say that no element (within the same containing element)should touch the left or righthand sides of a box.

- the design of the page needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.

- Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch.

- Fixed width layout designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. 


- Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window.


- To create a fixed width layout, the width of the main boxes on a page will usually be specified in pixels.

- The liquid layout uses percentages to specify the width of each box so that the design will stretch to fit the size of the screen.

- CSS frameworks aim to make your life easier by providing the code for common tasks.
